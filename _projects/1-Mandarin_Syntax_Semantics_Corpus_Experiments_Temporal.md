<i>Page under construction</i>

One of my main interests touches upon the question of the expression of time reference in Mandarin Chinese, which is often characterized as being a tenseless language. I aim to use corpus data as well as experimental (behavioral and neuroimaging) data to investigate how aspect and modal markers relate to the expression of time reference. In addition, I am also investigating markers found in several varieties of Mandarin Chinese, such as Taiwan Mandarin.

Parts of my research focusing on this topic can be found below:
