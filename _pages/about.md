### Short bio

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Linguistics of Academia Sinica, Taiwan. I work on my own project entitled "On the expression of temporal reference with modal information from a morphosyntactic and psycho-/neuro-linguistic perspective: The case of ‘<i>you</i> (to have) + VP’ in Taiwan Mandarin".

I graduated from the PhD program of the department of English of National Taiwan Normal University (Linguistic track). During my PhD studies, I was also the manager of the [Neurolinguistics Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/neurolinguisticslabntnu) of National Taiwan Normal University, where I supervized behavioral, ERP and fMRI experiments about a great variety of language-related topics, such as language relativity, classifier processing or conceptual categorization.

### Research interests

My research interests combine two disciplines: linguistics and language processing.

* On the linguistic side, I am interested in the syntax and semantics of the expression of TIME from a functional syntax and user-based perspective. Particularly, I aim at understanding how temporal relations are expressed with grammatical markers in Mandarin Chinese (and its variety spoken in Taiwan), which is said to be a tenseless language.
* On the psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic side, I have mainly worked in sentence processing with a focus on the processing of temporality (tense, aspect, modality) in grammar. 

I aim at bridging linguistic analyses with their brain processing patterns in order to establish a neurolinguistic and crosslinguistic model of the processing of temporality at the sentence level. Although I have mainly conducted my research on Mandarin Chinese, I also wish to expand my research to other languages, especially languages which are underrepresented in the language processing domain.
