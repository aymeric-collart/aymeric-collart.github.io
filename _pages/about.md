## PhD in Linguistics and Neurolinguistics

I graduated from the PhD program of the department of English of National Taiwan Normal University (Linguistic track). My research interests lie in the neurolinguistic and psycholinguistic domains, mostly about sentence processing. I am particularly interested in syntactic and semantic processing, with a focus on the processing of temporality (tense, aspect, modality) in language. I aim at bridging linguistic analyses with their brain processing fashion in order to establish a neurolinguistic and crosslinguistic model of the processing of temporality at the sentence level. I mainly conduct my research on Mandarin Chinese (aspect-prominent/tenseless language), but I wish to expand my research to other languages (such as Formosan languages or Indo-European languages). 

I am also the lab manager of the [Neurolinguistics Lab](https://neurolinguisticslabntnu.wordpress.com/) of National Taiwan Normal University, where behavioral, ERP and fMRI experiments about a great variety of language-related topics are conducted, such as language relativity, classifier processing, conceptual categorization, etc.
