## Welcome to my personal academic website!

My research interests lie in the neurolinguistic and psycholinguistic domains, mostly about sentence processing. I am particularly interested in syntactic and semantic processing, with a focus on the processing of temporality (tense, aspect, modality) in language. I aim at bridging linguistic analyses with their brain processing fashion in order to establish a neurolinguistic and crosslinguistic model of the processing of temporality at the sentence level. I mainly conduct my research on Mandarin Chinese (aspect-prominent/tenseless language), but I wish to expand my research to other languages (such as Formosan languages or Indo-European languages). 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Linguistics of Academia Sinica. I graduated from the PhD program of the department of English of National Taiwan Normal University (Linguistic track). I have also been the lab manager of the [Neurolinguistics Lab](https://neurolinguisticslabntnu.wordpress.com/) of National Taiwan Normal University for 4 years, where behavioral, ERP and fMRI experiments about a great variety of language-related topics are conducted, such as language relativity, classifier processing or conceptual categorization.
