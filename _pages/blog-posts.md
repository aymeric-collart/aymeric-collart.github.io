I believe in sharing experiences, no matter they are positive or negative, exciting or boring. This is the main reason for which I started writing weekly blog posts, to share what it is like to be in a PhD program in Taiwan. By communicating with other PhD students who had the same idea, it is as if a tiny community was being formed, and we discover that we are not alone!

Photography is one of my recent interest. I wish I can share to the world the small details of what I see in my everyday life. You can have a look at some pictures below.
